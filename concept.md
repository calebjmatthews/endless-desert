Incremental idle game about exploration and discovery in an endless desert

Ideas:
  - Basic resources: water, reeds, clay, sand, influence as currency.
  - Foods: Wheat, lentils, figs, dates, fish, bread, beer, onions, garlic, cheese, butter, spices.
  - Animals: Oxen, hens, fish, scarabs (for dye), cats.
  - Manufacturing: Press reeds into papyrus, roofing, or linen; smelt sand into glass lenses or bottles; form clay into bricks or jars.
  - Trading system with shifting prices to acquire iron, copper, various coins, ivory, wine, silk, wool, jade, tea, porcelain, honey, and gunpowder.
  - Research system that uses lenses to break down any item into concepts, ties together concepts into a completed theory. Research categories: philosophy (general knowledge), botany (farming), zoology (ranching), anthropology (music, entertainment, culture), physics (crafting), astrology (new exploration areas), chemistry (crafting), exaltation (mysteriously enhancing humans), and mysticism (contact with beings from another plane).
  - Find artifacts by sending out teams of explorers.
  - Groups lead by a named character with various traits that can be persuaded to stay in your settlement by using up influence or gifts.
  - Group leaders have a favorite food, favorite activity, and a secret wish. Fulfilling the secret wish gives a permanent boost to happiness.
  - Group-specific happiness influenced by quality of house; kind and quality of food, drink, clothing, presence of cats, and treasure; desirability of job. Happiness has a large effect on work performance, is displayed prominently, and can lead to special events.
  - Groups can be assigned to a specific building, which will dramatically increase the output of the building. Otherwise buildings are run by generic citizens (if the building has that capability). Buildings that produce artisan goods or an entertainment bonus can't be run by citizens.

Where is the bottleneck?
  - Creation of basic resources should be based on buildings (rather than working groups), with specialty goods for limited use or trade created by groups.
  - It should be relatively easy to sustain an existing settlement, and easy to expand by adding buildings, but without much value to be gained by stockpiling huge numbers of basic resources. Adding new groups should be difficult, and trading should have relatively low maximum numbers of resources, so the player cannot succeed by trading huge quantities of sand, for example.
  - Advanced products should require a mix of intermediate resources that come from the town and resources that have to be traded for.

Starting game state:
  - Buildings: one trading post, one hut, one cistern, one lentil field

Example game state:
  - Buildings: one town center, four houses, one cistern, one lentil field, two wheat field, one oxen pasture, one fish pond, three reed deltas, one clay pit, two sand pits, one dairy, three kitchens, two drying yards, one furnace, one glassblower, one amphitheatre
  - Initial products are: 110 water, 11 lentils, 11 wheat, 11 oxen, 11 fish, 33 reeds, 11 clay, 22 sand
  - Intermediate consumption is: 10 water -> 11 lentils, 20 water -> 22 wheat, 30 water + 10 wheat -> 11 oxen, 10 water -> 11 fish, 2 oxen + 5 water -> 16 cheese, 10 lentils + 2 water + 2 reeds -> 11 lentil soup, 10 wheat + 2 water + 2 reeds -> 11 bread, 10 fish + 2 reeds -> 11 baked fish, 10 reeds -> 11 roofing, 10 reeds -> 11 papyrus, 10 clay -> 11 bricks, 10 sand + 2 reeds -> 11 glass, 10 glass + 2 reeds -> 16 lenses
  - Final products are -19 water, 1 lentils, 2 wheat, 9 oxen, 1 fish, 3 reeds, 1 clay, 12 sand, 6 cheese, 1 lentil soup, 1 bread, 1 baked fish, 11 papyrus, 11 roofing, 11 clay bricks, 1 glass, 16 lenses
