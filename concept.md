## Ideas:
  - Basic resources: water, reeds, clay, and sand.
  - Foods: Grain, lentils, figs, dates, goards, fish, bread, beer, onions, garlic, cheese, butter, spices (coriander, cinnamon, carob, garlic, chicory).
  - Animals: Ox, quail, fish, bees, scarabs (for dye), cats.
  - Manufacturing: Press reeds into papyrus, roofing, or linen; smelt sand into glass lenses or bottles; form clay into bricks or jars.
  - Trading system with shifting prices to acquire iron, copper, various coins, ivory, wine, silk, wool, jade, tea, porcelain, honey, wax, and gunpowder.
  - Research system that uses lenses to break down any item into concepts, ties together concepts into a completed theory. Research categories: philosophy (general knowledge), biology (farming), zoology (ranching), anthropology (music, entertainment, culture), physics (crafting), astrology (new exploration areas), chemistry (crafting), exaltation (mysteriously enhancing humans), and mysticism (contact with beings from another plane).
  - Find artifacts by sending out teams of explorers.
  - Groups lead by a named character with various traits that can be persuaded to stay in your settlement by using up influence or gifts.
  - Group leaders have a favorite food, favorite activity, and a secret wish. Fulfilling the secret wish gives a permanent boost to happiness.
  - Group leaders can equip clothing, a pack (that goes on the back), and a tool. These can affect their quantity of products created, quality of products created, amount of resources consumed when creating a product, bonus when entertaining the town, speed when traveling to an exploration site, ability to disarm traps when exploring, and resilience to damage when exploring.
  - Leader-specific happiness influenced by quality of house; kind and quality of food, drink, clothing, presence of cats, and treasure; desirability of job. Happiness has a large effect on work performance, is displayed prominently, and can lead to special events.
  - Groups can be assigned to a specific building, which will dramatically increase the output of the building. Otherwise buildings are run by generic citizens (if the building has that capability). Buildings that produce artisan goods or an entertainment bonus can't be run by citizens.
  - Sunset gradient: #f58f7d @ 0, #6a41b4 @ 67, #0034aa @ 100
  - Day gradient?: linear-gradient(#009aaa, #a1ded0, #f5cb7d);
  - Night gradient?: linear-gradient(#000d2d, #001869, #484396); //
  - Chemistry research for Perfumery, need original perfume to be able to duplicate.
  - Logistics research that increases building output if located next to the source of its consumption resources.
  - Logistics research that increases output if group leader lives next to where he/she is working.
  - Product quality:
    - Products can have something akin to a critical success that produces a "fine" version of the resource.
    - A double-critical is also possible: 110% change of quality product would = 90% chance of "fine" and 10% change of "exquisite".
    - A "fine" product is worth 4x the value of a normal product, and has the sentence "It's of fine quality." added to the end of the description.
    - An "exquisite" product is worth 16x the vault of a normal product, and has "The quality is exquisite; this is fit for royalty!" added to the end of the description.
  - Exploring requires a specific set of provisions: initially this just includes food and drink, but later can include things like rope, medicine, shovels, camels, and special clothing.
  - Rendering extracts from various materials for perfumery/other uses
    - Rendering occurs at a crucible. The user can create a repeating pattern of ingredients, and each has set duration to render.
    - Rendering many things in a short time increases the crucible heat from gentle -> moderate -> strong -> incinerating, where a higher heat can produce a higher quality extract but has a higher chance of destroying the ingredient.
    -  Strong heat has the best ratio, and while incinerating technically has a higher chance to return a quality extract, it is almost certain to destroy the item.
    -  Perfumes/other products are created by account-specific combinations of extracts.
    -  Extract types include: Sweet (pink), Sour (green), Bitter (purple), Brackish (dark blue), Savory (orange), Spicy (red), Cooling (light blue), Herbal (green), Deep (shining yellow), Strange (shining purple), Rich (shining green), Airy (shining blue)
  - Somewhat hidden overall goal is to find the secret of undoing death, the quest for which cannot be tainted by killing. There could be a previous explorer (or duo?) who searched for the secret, and an elusive beast that has to willingly give you its eye.
  - Temporary settlements can be made in the Dreaming (the River of Pearls?), last 24 hours (?) before evaporating and allowing the player to claim one single resource.
    - These can have produce unusual resources, such as metal, wood, or stone.
    - These can have unusual ruined buildings, such as sculpture gardens and luthiers.
    - They can also be unusually small or large.
    - Some way to apply extreme benefits, often with drawbacks. These could include:
      - Build time x 1000 in large island that is continuously shrinking
      - One resource production x 100 (but can't claim that resource)
      - Randomizing the output of resources with a subcategory
      - Broad availability of raw resources, but no leaders can be found
      - Buildings produce much more, but can only be built once and only work for an hour before vanishing
      - Highly beneficial trades arrive each hour, but must be completed within five minutes or the island vanishes
      - Leaders who are incredibly effective at a single task, and vanish after working for one hour
      - No resource can be claimed, but resources can be used towards a single dream expedition one of whose rewards can be claimed
  - Fortuities:
    - Entertainer will perform in settlement, in exchange for several options of items (food, drink, gold, etc)
    - Traveling scholar will offer progress in a started research, or a random research if none are started
    - Explorer offers to unusually good randomly generated expedition
    - Gain of small amount of unusual resource
    - Wanderer offers tip (+ Knowledge)
    - Natural phenomena (animal migration, plant blooming after rain, atrological event) with small knowledge gain and travel notes later
    - Exploring craftsman gives you blueprints
    - Crafting-type leader has an inspiration for a craft, and requires specific resources to create
  - Thief found stealing food/water at your settlement and can either be kicked out or allowed to stay, if allowed to stay will become a trader whose merchandise you can select
  - Building that refines sand into pure sand+subcategory resource
  - Cooking allows free-form selection of ingredients, produces Mistake if not valid recipe
  - Furnaces initially can use reeds as fuel, then require charcoal, then lenses (as a solar furnace)
  - The Firefly
    - "Who are you?" "flame     flying   fires      soaring     heat air     fiery wind"
    - Giver of most quests
  - Late game long term craft: create a moon
    - Gives an array of bonuses that apply to your town during a specific time or times of day
    - Common for a moon to have one set of bonuses for half the day, and a different for the remainder; e.g. a moon with + Quality for Dishes in the dawn and dusk and + Speed for Crops in the noon and night
    - Can create a moon with specific attributes to appeal to certain buyers
  - Expedition introductory quest
    - Cries in the night: Samannoud wants to  investigate unexplained cries coming from nearby in the night
    - Some connection with Alabaster; refugees? bandits?
  - Expedition relics:
    - Shell from something mythical
    - Resin from something mythical
    - Maps to find other expeditions
    - Petrtified wood
    - Ancient seeds
    - Stone tablets containing poetry, stone dice, stone figurines, stone masks

## Where is the bottleneck?
  - Creation of basic resources should be based on buildings (rather than working groups), with specialty goods for limited use or trade created by groups.
  - It should be relatively easy to sustain an existing settlement, and easy to expand by adding buildings, but without much value to be gained by stockpiling huge numbers of basic resources. Adding new groups should be difficult, and trading should have relatively low maximum numbers of resources, so the player cannot succeed by trading huge quantities of sand, for example.
  - Advanced products should require a mix of intermediate resources that come from the town and resources that have to be traded for.

## Research option flow:
  - Pull the options specific to the research, then the options for its category and difficulty
  - If there are unused manditory options => remaining rounds, use one of those as only option
  - Remove the options that have already been used as part of this research
  - Look at the number of remaining steps: if there are <= steps as research-specific options, only choose from those
  - If the card slot is > 1, include secondary options in pool
  - If there are >, make weighted choice from any in the pool
  - If there are no non-secondary options remaining in the pool, restore all previously used options

## Option cost application:
  - If specificity is exact, deduct material at once
  - If specificity is tag or category, open resource selection modal
  - Check if all costs have been fulfilled, if so mark research completed and change component to "Finished!"
  - If not, add research option paid (research option name -> cost type) cost object to research options deck

## Resource selection:
  - Only show matching resources, sorted with highest quantity first
  - If only one matching resource exists, have it auto-selected
  - Can manually enter in quantity after selecting, but auto-fills to cost quantity

## Caches:
  - Give random amounts of relics, which are resources used to construct cosmetics
  - After creating a new file an "Heirloom Cache" is available for super cheap ($0.50?)
  - Otherwise a "Mysterious Cache" is available every week for $1 and a "Grand Cache" is available every month for $5. Grand Caches include a clue that leads to a unique mysticism research and series of explorations that result in more relics

## Research:
  - Study action, inspect an item that has not been studied before to gain knowledge
  - Analyze action, Gain knowledge by destroying a resource and studying its parts
  - Field notes are brought back by explorers, even when an exploration fails. There are also ways of gathering field notes about the town itself. Example field notes are "Notes on the Western Stars", "Notes on the Waning Moon", "Notes on Flowing Water", "Notes on Caves Beneath the Sand", etc.
  - Research difficulty works as follows:
    - Easiest difficulty uses very small amounts of knowledge, water, and lentils
    - Easy difficulty uses small amounts of knowledge water, lentils, clay, sand, wood, and reeds
    - Moderate difficulty uses early refined materials such as glass and bricks, more advanced dishes, as well as papyrus and ink
    - Higher difficulty uses field notes and higher refined materials
    - High difficulty uses rarer field notes, high-quality dishes, complex refined materials, and rarer exploration rewards

## Equipment:
  - Tools: Apply happiness to production (heavy tools), quality (precise tools), or efficiency (long tools)
    * Building specific: mattock (generic - speed), implements (generic - quality), pole (generic - efficiency), pot of sealant pitch (water), hoe (field-crop), shovel (pit-earth), weight (press-pressed), bellows (furnace-smelted), rake (dried-drying yard), pan (dish-kitchen), loom (textile), tongs (glassblower), spanner (atelier), needle (tailor), scissors (outfitter), hammer (fabricator)
    * Unique tools: Prismatic Shovel (X% chance sand harvested becomes any type), Temperate Char-bellows (Large increase in charcoal quality, wood efficiency), Fervent Char-bellows (Large increase in charcoal speed, decrease in wood efficiency), Olive Grafting Tongs (increase in Olive quality, increase in Water efficiency), Reed Mud-hoe (large increase in Reed speed, decrease in efficiency), Broad Clay-Spade (moderate increase to Clay speed)
  - Clothing: Usually increases happiness or generic increases to production, quality, or efficiency
    * Ascetic's Robe: Decreases food and drink usage
    * Can be a broader category, rather than building specific: gatherer's tunic (earth), craftsman's overalls (refined materials), artisan's apron (artisan goods)
  - Back: Effects are varied and have a negative element, but usually just a single effect per equipment
    * Journeyman's Haversack: + speed but - quality/efficiency
    * Journeyman's Gearbag: + efficiency but - quality/speed
    * Journeyman's Toolpack: + quality but - speed/efficiency
    * Unique tools: Shoulder parasol (huge increase to Water efficiency, decreased general speed), Fan-shaped Cloak (increased Fuel efficiency, decreased general speed)
  - Effect ideas: + production but - efficiency, + quality but - production/efficiency, + efficiency but - production, decreased food consumption, increased Knowledge from studying/analysis, decreased build time, special fortuities, increased basic status but decreased happiness
  - Tiers of equipment are from 1 - 5, with probs as follows:
    * Basic unmarked equipment is 80% 1, 18% 2, 2% 3
    * Fine unmarked equipment is 80% 2, 18% 3, 2% 4
    * Exquisite unmarked equipment is 80% 3, 18% 4, 2% 5
  - Effect display for leaders combines identical effects, and shows the cumulative total of overlapping effects. For example: Speed +10%, Speed +5%, Drink Speed +10%, Water Speed +5% would give the final effects Speed +16%, Drink Speed +27%, and Water Speed +33%

## Cooking:
  - Any combination of five ingredients can be selected, quality is a sum of ingredient quality + a multiplier for the dish
  - Several things can be used as a main ingredient: Lentils, Quail, Fish, Onion, Dates
  - These create the psuedo resource type for the final dish resource according to the tag they fall into: for example Lentils are a vegetable, so a dish with Lentils, Milk, and Water would be called "Plain Lentil Soup", but would have the resource type of "Vegetable Soup" for the purposes of grouping and studying
  - Soup = Ingredient + Water
  - Bread = Grain + Water
  - Omelet = Ingredient + Egg + Water
  - Stew = Ingredient + Milk
  - Pie = Ingredient + Grain + Water
  - Cake = Ingredient + Grain + Milk + Egg
  - Oil and spice can be added to any recipe to increase value
  - Adjectives come from a spice used in the dish (or oil), then the main ingredient used in the dish. "Plain" is used if there is no spice or oil, "Tasty" is used if there is oil but no spice, and "Spiced" is used if there is more than one spice. For example, Lentils + Water + Olive Oil = "Tasty Lentil Soup", Fish + Grain + Water + Peppercorns = "Peppered Fish Pie", Onion + Egg + Water = "Plain Onion Omelet"

## Expeditions:
- Colossal underground "House of Forms" produced sap (?) that healed all sickness and sated all hunger, and had some method of existing in multiple locations at once (?); Various expeditions go to different locations within the House:
  - Gardens with reward of rare seeds and plant-related equipment
  - Library with knowledge-related rewards
  - Kitchens with recipes, rare ingredients, and cooking-related equipment
  - Storehouse with high quality base resources
  - Armory with combat-themed equipment
  - Bedrooms with luxury clothing
  - Servant's quarters with working tools and clothes
- Expedition method:
  - Pick a cardinal direction, a previously visited region (if map making has been learned), or previously visited destination (also if map making has been leared),
  - For every area that is traversed through, various random events can occur. This could:
    - Change the direction the expedition is heading (the party gets lost)
    - Delay the party unless food, drink, or a specific implement is used up, or unless the leader is a certain personality type
    - Give an opportunity to plant special seeds (e.g. date) for later retrieval
    - Capture an animal with rope
    - Meet with a special trading partner
    - Start a special repeatable quest
    - Unexpected expedition destination (mirage castle?)

## Exploration:
- Implements give points in the following categories:
  - Seek (Torch): Spotting treasure, traps, and enemies
  - Break (Slab): Breaking through containers and walls
  - Trap (Gearwork): Immobilizing foes
  - Loose (Edge): Escaping immobilization
  - Heal (Binding): Undoing damage
- Leaders learn techniques from codexes, each technique uses a combination of points from implements
- Attitudes determine how a leader moves through the site
  - Cautious: Avoid enemies
  - Swift: Leave after finding grand treasure
  - Curious: Seek out all treasures
  - Reckless: Seek out and trap enemies

## Field Notes:
  - Required for many research options of difficulty 2 and higher

## Time cycle:
  - The desert transitions from day to night over the course of an hour.
  - Morning is from :00 - :15, day from :15 - :30, evening from :30 - :45, and night from :45 - :00
  - Twenty four days consitute a month, and twenty eight to thirty one days consistute a year.

## Example game state:
  - Buildings: one town center, four houses, one cistern, one lentil field, two grain field, one oxen pasture, one fish pond, three reed deltas, one clay pit, two sand pits, one dairy, three kitchens, two drying yards, one furnace, one glassblower, one amphitheatre
  - Initial products are: 110 water, 11 lentils, 11 grain, 11 oxen, 11 fish, 33 reeds, 11 clay, 22 sand
  - Intermediate consumption is: 10 water -> 11 lentils, 20 water -> 22 grain, 30 water + 10 grain -> 11 oxen, 10 water -> 11 fish, 2 oxen + 5 water -> 16 cheese, 10 lentils + 2 water + 2 reeds -> 11 lentil soup, 10 grain + 2 water + 2 reeds -> 11 bread, 10 fish + 2 reeds -> 11 baked fish, 10 reeds -> 11 roofing, 10 reeds -> 11 papyrus, 10 clay -> 11 bricks, 10 sand + 2 reeds -> 11 glass, 10 glass + 2 reeds -> 16 lenses
  - Final products are -19 water, 1 lentils, 2 grain, 9 oxen, 1 fish, 3 reeds, 1 clay, 12 sand, 6 cheese, 1 lentil soup, 1 bread, 1 baked fish, 11 papyrus, 11 roofing, 11 clay bricks, 1 glass, 16 lenses
  - Four groups are eating cheese, lentil soup, bread, baked fish, and drinking water; one exploring, one cheese making, one lens crafting, one playing music.

## Calculating timestep:
  - "Hourglass" class used to calculate tick related events
  - Production/consumption always calculated using a diff between two timestamps
  - P/C sets for buildings have a "tier" which is determined by the complexity of the resources they're consuming, one higher than the highest tiered resource that went into its production. For example, a cistern has a tier of 0 because it consumes nothing to produce water. Bread has a tier of 2, because it consumes water (tier 0, ignored) and grain (tier 1, increased by 1)
  - The effective rates of all buildings are calculated, relative to the resources available, and this rate is stored and used until one or more buildings are changed. Resources will be used at 100% capacity until a required resource is exhaused
  - When calculating larger timestamp durations (>10 seconds), if one or more resources have a negative production the hourglass will calculate when the negative resource will run out, and then recalculate rates for that resource. The resource will be rounded down and set at 0 at this point
  - Example: Beginning with timestamp 2000, with Red Clay|0 running out at 2800 and Lentils|0 running out at 3200, and current timestamp of 4000. First soonestExhaustion at 2800, calculate results between 2000 and 2800. Inactivate buildings that use Red Clay|0 by recalculating rates, second soonestExhaustion at 3200 and calculate results between 2800 and 3200. Inactivate buildings that use Lentils|0 by recalculating rates and calculate results between 3200 and 4000.

## Building display:
  - Start by going through each building, and creating an array the building types with duplicates
  - Go through each building again, creating a display object that can be either a building group or a single building, with a building group for those with duplicates
  - Pull the building specific or building group rates from the rate reducer

## Beginning of game:
  - Some messages to introduce setting
    * "Rumors say anything can be found in the desert: ancient knowledge, buried jade, even a path back from the land of the dead. But perhaps it was foolish to run towards its center on your own."
    * "Your food and water are long gone, your breath gasping and your steps slow, when you find a ruined village."
  - Start with no tabs, just a single button that says "Look around". Clicking this displays another introductory message, unlocks the "Resources" and "Buildings" tabs, and gives a small quantity of water, lentils, seeds, clay, wood, and sand
    * "There are signs of conflict here: a shattered gate, broken doors, and ransacked huts. But there aren't any bodies. Maybe the villagers fled as the raiders approached. You find some meager leavings in the rubble."
  - Inside the "Buildings" tab have "Broken cistern", "Decaying study", "Ruined huts", "Fallow field", "Shattered dome", and "Abandoned market"
  - Second action is in the "Build" button: "Repair cistern", which creates the cistern building and gives a large amount of water
    * Repairing the broken cistern wasn't difficult, and the results are well worth it. Instead of streaming through the cracked side, water begins steadily filling the gigantic basin.
  - Third action: "Refurbish housing", which creates one hut and the study, and unlocks the "Research" tab
    * With some effort, you fix the broken doors, sweep out the sand, and patch the walls to keep out howling winds. There are now a handful of tiny but livable huts, and a small study you can use for your own purposes.
  - Fourth action: "Restore field", which creates one lentil field
    * You'd never tilled the ground before, and it wasn't pleasant. But there were enough leftover bags of seed and fallow lentil plants to make a productive field.
  - Event where one leader moves in and unlocks the "Leaders" tab
  - Action after researching "Trading": "Revamp market" which opens the "Trading" tab
  - Action after researching "Exploration" "Recreate gate" which opens the "Exploration" tab

## Music
  - Daily card-based minigame that creates a benefit that applies to your entire town for 36 hours.
  - Cards can be created from Inspiration; one is created from the daily performance.
  - Cards have positive and negative effects on resource rates, as well as directly increasing or decreasing resources. The can also affect research, building speed, and exploration.
  - Also, cards have meta-effects within the performance mini-game (draw cards, discard cards, retreive from discard, permanently create cards, permanently destroy cards).

## Hawk Bazaar
  - Hawk your wares!
  - One per day, send out a passenger hawk containing any quantity of a resource at a price set by the player
  - Use hawk scrip to send out more hawks than the single daily hawk
  - Buy as many things from the Hawk Bazaar as you wish
  - When sending out a hawk, see a suggested price based on the average of the last ten? successful trades, excluding outliers?, and lacking recent trades the total value of the resources to be traded

## Building Limits
  - Initial stage, 6 to start: 3 special, 1 housing, 2 material
  - At Field Notes stage, 22 is comfortable: 3 special, 4 housing, 10 material, 5 refinement
  - Stages could go: 12, 15, 20, 25, 31, 36, 40
  - Starting, Sand+Clay, Wood+Brick, Iron+Bronze, Steel+Ceramic, Artifact, Pearl-thing

## Secondary Research Options
  - Knowledge cost to discard current options and redraw
  - Reduce progress by one to gain scholarship-type field notes
  - Large resource cost to gain scholarship-type field notes
  - Large dish and drink cost
  - Leader specific assistance

## How to handle surplus of leaders?
  - Don't have an option of too many leaders
    - This isn't ideal, could be fun to have tons of seasonal or premium leaders
  - Different housing types that can hold more than one leader (and crew)
  - Moving fortress that runs on waterwheels turned by golden oil, surplus leaders can work there for ocational non-scaling benefits

## Tips
  - Dishes make excellent trade goods. It can be useful to build a Kitchen, even before the town is producing enough ingredients to run it continuously.
  - As trading partners come to trust you, they will set aside a larger part of their caravan's capacity for you. This means larger trades are possible.
  - More complicated buildings require the skilled hand of a leader to keep them running. But as your research improves, you'll be able to build simplified versions that don't need a leader.
  - It's only possible to analyze 100 of anything at a time, and the more valuable something is the longer it takes to analyze. However, it might eventually be possible to analyze much faster.

## Value checking table
  - Should display current value, name, building that produces, computed value from rate of production + value of ingredients + value of building

## Styling:
  - Fine border:
    border-style: outset;
    border-width: 3px;
    border-color: #aecae0;
  - Fine text:
    color: #6a7791;
    text-shadow: 0px 0px 1px #a3bcdb;
  - Aroma tag:
    background-color: #fff
    border-color: #fff;
    box-shadow: 0 0px 5px 3px #ffffff6b;
